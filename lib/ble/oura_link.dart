// The HOST for the Oura ring: hold the pairing key, hold the drain cursor,
// hold the time anchor, connect, drive [OuraAdapter] over the link, and bank
// what comes back.
//
// NOTHING HERE HAS MET HARDWARE. Nobody on this project owns a ring (owner
// ruling R6), so not one byte of this path has been exercised against one. The
// registry entry stays EXPERIMENTAL, `OuraAdapter.signals` stays `const {}`,
// and nothing this file writes becomes a number: its rows carry a non-null
// `source`, and every derive/export read filters `source IS NULL`. That is
// correct behaviour for an uncalibrated decoder, not a limitation to route
// around.
//
// THE SHAPE, AND WHY IT IS NOT `HrsLink`'s. A heart-rate strap is a live
// session armed by a workout; the ring is a FETCH-BY-CURSOR store. So this is
// a one-shot [OuraLink.sync] — connect, drain to the end of history, tear down
// — rather than an arm/disarm pair. Everything else is the same host work in
// the same order: read the `device` row, connect by `remote_id`, discover,
// check [GattBandLink.missingCharacteristics], drive `run()`, buffer, commit,
// disconnect.
//
// WHAT THIS FILE OWNS THAT THE ADAPTER DELIBERATELY CANNOT (see `oura.dart`'s
// own header):
//
//  1. THE 16-BYTE PAIRING KEY, in the platform keychain/keystore — never in
//     the database. See [_readKey].
//  2. THE DRAIN CURSOR, a decisecond on the ring's own clock, in `sync_cursor`
//     so a drain resumes instead of re-fetching.
//  3. THE TIME ANCHOR, the `(ring decisecond, Unix second)` pair, persisted
//     beside the cursor and handed back in at the next connect. This is the fix
//     for the cross-session origin hazard — see below.
//
// THE HOST HOLDS THE ORIGIN, THE ADAPTER STAMPS WITH IT. There is exactly one
// implementation of "which second is this decisecond", and it is
// `OuraAdapter._anchorUnixFor`. The host reads the stored `(ds, unix)` pair,
// hands it in at construction, and writes back the better one the adapter
// reports when a `time_sync` event gives it a measured pair — inside the same
// transaction as the rows that pair stamped. Two implementations of an origin
// would be two origins, which is the whole failure this mechanism exists to
// stop: the same physiological second written under two different `ts_ms`,
// which REPLACE cannot collapse because they no longer share a key.
//
// ABSTAINING IS THE CORRECT ANSWER WHEN THERE IS NO ORIGIN. A session with no
// measured `time_sync` and nothing stored writes NO timestamped row. The frames
// are still archived verbatim — the bytes are banked, and a plausible wrong
// `ts_ms` is worse than a missing one.
//
// THE DESTRUCTIVE COMMANDS ARE UNREACHABLE FROM HERE, and their absence is the
// only thing making that true. `GattBandLink`'s dangerous-opcode block reads an
// opcode out of a WHOOP envelope and answers null for an unframed band, so it
// does NOT cover this ring (ASSUMPTIONS I1). The ring has a factory reset, a
// DFU state machine, a flight mode, a manufacturing-mode setter and a
// bulk-sampler erase. This file writes NOTHING it did not get from a builder in
// the protocol package's Oura wire format, that module has no builder for any
// of them, and `oura_link_test.dart` asserts that every byte this host puts on
// the wire came from a builder that exists. The one command here that writes
// ring state is the key install, and it writes a credential rather than
// erasing anything.
